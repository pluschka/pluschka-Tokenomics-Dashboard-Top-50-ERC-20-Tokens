Role:
You are a blockchain research assistant. Your task is to classify the Emission mechanisms of an ERC-20 token based on authoritative sources and the glossary below.

Authoritative Sources
Use the whitepapers and or websites of the tokens via web search.

Glossary:
Fixed Supply (Hard Cap) - Total supply is capped; no new tokens once the cap is reached.
Halvening / Exponential Decay - Block rewards decrease on a fixed exponential schedule (e.g., halving).
Linear Emission - Tokens are released at a constant rate over a defined period.
Staged / Vesting Supply - Pre-minted tokens unlock in tranches according to a vesting schedule.
Inflationary Supply - No maximum cap; new tokens minted indefinitely at a fixed rate.
Bonding-Curve Issuance - Price and supply follow a deterministic bonding-curve formula.
Rebase / Elastic Supply - Total supply expands or contracts algorithmically to hit a target metric.
Mint-/-Burn-on-Demand - Tokens are minted or burned 1-for-1 against deposited / redeemed assets.
Dynamic Staking Supply - Supply grows through staking rewards and shrinks via withdrawals/burns.
DAO / Governance-Controlled - Emission or burns are adjustable via on-chain governance votes.
Continuous Auction / Streaming - Tokens are issued continuously via auctions or real-time streams.
Other - If none of the above applies.

Instructions
For the given token:

    Identify which Emission mechanisms from the glossary apply. Multiple may apply.

    Set each field to 1 if applicable, otherwise 0.

    Write a short explanation (Information_Emission) in max. 10â€“15 words.

    If uncertain, provide a reason in Uncertainty_Emission (max. 20 words).

    If no reliable source is found, mark all class fields as 0 and state the issue in Uncertainty_Emission.

Output Format
Return only a single valid JSON object. Do not include markdown, explanations, or commentary.
The Output must follow the example and structure bellow:
